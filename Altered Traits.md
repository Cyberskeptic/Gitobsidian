Any spell that adds or worsens disadvantages, reduces or removes advantages, or lowers attributes or characteristics adds +1 energy for every 5 character points removed.

One that adds or improves advantages, reduces or removes disadvantages, or increases attributes or characteristics adds +1 energy for every 1 character point added. Any disadvantage with a self-control roll (p. B120) allows the target a chance to avoid it; multiply the value of the disadvantage by 2.5 if there is no self-control roll allowed.

The GM may permit a single spell effect to alter multiple traits, but only if they make sense together; e.g., a Lesser Destroy Body effect that adds Hard of Hearing -10 and Protected Hearing 5 for a net +7 energy.

If a trait has been artificially reduced (e.g., by another spell), a spell that adds it back to the subject will “heal” the loss permanently. See Restore (p. 16) and the example under Magic vs. Magic (p. 24).

You cannot add Magery, Ritual Adept, etc., and any HP or FP added cannot be sacrificed for magical energy. See Stacking Spells (p. 15) for why
