	40 points 
Prerequisite: [[Magery]] 0+. 

You are a potent spellcaster, able to pull off impressive rituals in less time than it takes other casters to do a cantrip. You can work anywhere ([[Consecrate Space]] or not) and require no special connection to your subject. The GM must decide if this advantage is inborn or if it can be learned; if he doesn’t say, assume it’s inherent and cannot be acquired after character creation.
