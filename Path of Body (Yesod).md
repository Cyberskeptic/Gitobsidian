Prerequisite: [[Thaumatology]]. 

Governs any effects which target the flesh and blood (or chlorophyll, etc.) of living things. It can target seeds and trees (which are still growing), but not fallen branches or harvested fruits. This is the Path of physical effects and changes; use the Path of Mind (pp. 11-12) to target someone’s thoughts or emotions, even if you’re justifying it as “affecting hormone levels” or something similar. Lesser Body effects allow localized, believable, and subtle changes – or provide basic information. Greater Body effects can be blatant, complete, and/or superhuman in nature. 

[[Sense]] Body: Lesser Sense Body can identify what species or race someone is, detect all living things nearby, detect all members of one particular species nearby, locate the physical presence of one particular person you know, or diagnose any medical problem that a doctor could potentially identify. Greater Sense Body can reveal a person’s full genealogy, determine the exact moment someone was poisoned, diagnose an issue that medical science could not, or determine when someone will die of natural causes. 

[[Strengthen]] Body: Lesser Strengthen Body can improve someone’s physical attributes or secondary characteristics by up to about 30% (rounded up), add any exotic physical traits that the GM would permit the subject to have with an Unusual Background (e.g., DR 1-2 (Tough Skin, -40%), in most games), add any mundane physical traits, provide up to +5 to rolls for physical actions, or provide any degree of bonus to resist metabolic hazards (e.g., disease or poison). Greater Strengthen Body can surpass the limits of Lesser Strengthen Body (e.g., improving ST by 100%) or add any physical trait that doesn’t change the subject’s morphology (that is, DR 20 or Hyperspectral Vision are fine, but Extra Heads and Flight (Winged) are not). 

[[Restore]] Body: Lesser Restore Body can provide healing up to twice as good as what First Aid could provide (e.g., up to 2d in a TL8 game; see p. B424), cure diseases with a finite duration, restore any amount of FP, revive a stunned or unconscious subject, or counteract any degree of temporary penalties or imposed traits (e.g., from a spell, Affliction, or drug). Greater Restore Body can heal any amount of HP, cure diseases that normally last indefinitely, end a person’s coma or heart attack, or remove permanent disadvantages (though only as long as the spell lasts). 

[[Control]] Body: Lesser Control Body can cause a single irritating or incapacitating affliction (p. B428), stun a target, force someone to perform a simple reflexive action (e.g., sneezing or dropping a weapon), obstruct the use of a limb (treat it as being grappled), or prevent the subject from actively using a particular trait. Greater Control Body can force a person to perform any physical action (no matter how complex) or physically move an entire living being (as if by telekinesis). 

[[Destroy]] Body: Lesser Destroy Body can cause internal damage (up to about what a handheld weapon in the setting could inflict with a single blow or shot). Greater Destroy Body can do unlimited damage, cause a coma or heart attack, or do partial destructions (e.g., eliminating a body’s ability to feel pain). Both versions can also reduce attributes and secondary characteristics, and inflict disadvantages (or negated advantages); use the guidelines for Strengthen Body (above), but reversed. 

[[Create]] Body: Lesser Create Body can “stabilize” the physical form of a spirit that has already manifested, so it doesn’t have to expend its own energy to remain on this plane. Greater Create Body can generate a vessel for any spirit (even one that can’t materialize) or be used in conjunction with Create Mind (p. 12) to summon living things out of thin air.

[[Transform]] Body: Lesser Transform Body can change someone’s blood type, alter his DNA or chromosomes to fool a test, improve or reduce his Appearance by up to two levels (while obviously maintaining his identity), or make him look like someone similar (that is, someone he could have already impersonated using a disguise kit). Greater Transform Body can alter someone’s species, make the subject look like anyone, or add any exotic physical traits (even those that change the subject’s morphology).
