Prerequisite: [[Thaumatology]]. 

This Path governs tangible, unliving, inanimate objects – from rocks to dead bodies to cellular phones. It can’t affect an apple tree, but it can affect a plucked apple (which is no longer growing). In many ways, it’s the material counterpart to the [[Path of Energy (Geburah)|Path Of Energy]] (pp. 9-10). Lesser Matter effects are simple and “rough” – not very precise – and are limited to interacting with the matter in a way that the laws of nature and physics would agree with. Greater Matter effects can be very precise and/or blatantly impossible. ([[Create]] and [[Transform]] effects are an exception, as they are blatantly impossible by definition.) 

[[Sense]] Matter: Lesser Sense Matter can locate the nearest object made of a specific material, locate the nearest knife, identify something’s general composition (e.g., “stainless steel with an oak handle”), or tell how old something is. Greater Sense Matter can locate a specific item that the caster has previously analyzed (or is very familiar with), provide a complete chemical or metallurgical breakdown of an object, or identify and separate fingerprints on a surface. 

[[Strengthen]] Matter: Lesser Strengthen Matter can improve an object’s ST or HT by up to 30%, or its HP or DR by up to 100% (round up). It can make food take twice as long to rot or make it twice as nourishing. It can keep a ship seaworthy after it’s down to 0 HP (but no worse). Greater Strengthen Matter can surpass those limits (e.g., improving HT by 50%). 

[[Restore]] Matter: Lesser Restore Matter can fix an object (up to the equivalent of a minor repair), remove a curse from an item, or make spoiled food edible again. Greater Restore Matter can perform the equivalent of a major repair (or more!), undo the ravages of time upon an object, or regrow a half-eaten apple into a whole one. Control Matter: Lesser 

[[Control]] Matter can make an object move in any natural way (e.g., rolling a bowling ball across a hallway or knocking something over), slow the speed of a river, prevent hail from hitting a particular object, or force a toaster to hold its bread long enough to catch fire. Greater Control Matter can move an object in impossible ways (e.g., making a bowling ball fly), cause water to flow uphill, or shape soft matter into any form desired. 

[[Destroy]] Matter: Lesser Destroy Matter can inflict internal damage (up to about what a handheld weapon in the setting could inflict with a single blow or shot), reduce an object’s statistics (e.g., ST, HT, HP, or DR) to half normal value (rounded up), or cause any irritating or incapacitating affliction appropriate for the object in question. Greater Destroy Matter can surpass the limits of Lesser Destroy Matter, or can work a partial destruction (e.g., destroying a fire extinguisher’s ability to quench flames, with no other changes). 

[[Create]] Matter: Lesser Create Matter can conjure raw materials, simple tools, food, solid melee weapons, fuel, or wood furniture. Greater Create Matter can summon more complex things, such as firearms, electronic devices, crossbows, or vehicles. For food, fuel, and similar consumables, the matter need only last long enough for it to be fully processed; once the body or system has fully converted it to energy, there’s nothing left to disappear when the spell ends. (For food, this usually requires a duration of three days.) 

[[Transform]] Matter: Lesser Transform Matter can reshape hard materials or make a minor change to an object’s substance; e.g., a steel crowbar could be made into iron or aluminum, but not peanut butter. A spell can use two Lesser Transform Matter effects to (e.g.) turn a steel crowbar into an aluminum cooking pot. Greater Transform Matter can completely alter matter, turning stone into air, a dead body into a computer, or a wooden table into an ice sculpture of the caster.
