Magic is both an art and a science. With the right combinations of words, motions, and mindset, a person can bend the universe to his will. A dedicated caster will put in years (if not decades, or even centuries!) of training, to hone his skill and power until he can safely work potent spells. Unfortunately, those too impatient for such schooling have plenty of shortcuts available, often with dangerous consequences.

### Words of Magic

- **adept**: Someone with the [[Ritual Adept]](p. 6) advantage. All adepts  are also mages. 
- **caster**: Someone using a Path skill to perform a ritual. Short for “spellcaster.” Anyone with at least one point in [[Thaumatology]] skill may be a caster – mages and adepts are just better at it. 
- **core skill**: A skill that represents fundamental magical knowledge and limits the caster’s [[Ritual Path Magic|RItual path skill]]. Usually Thaumatology (p. 6), but that can be changed. 
- **mage**: Someone with Magery. May or may not be an adept. 
- **[[Magery]]**: When used in this work, always refers to the Magery (Ritual Path) (p. 5) advantage, except when explicitly contrasted with “standard Magery.” 
- **Path skill**: One of the nine skills listed on pp. 7-12. Limited by both the caster’s core skill and his Magery level. 
- ritual: A specific magical effect (e.g., “Put that security guard to sleep.”). spell: See ritual.

### Learning Magic

Where the core skill of Thaumatology represents theoretical knowledge, all practical spellcasting is done with the following nine Path skills. Each Path governs one aspect of reality; between all nine, nearly any non-permanent effect is possible. 

Each Path has a common name and a lesser-used, sephirotic one which follows in parentheses; see The [[The Sephirot And Decans]] (pp. 35-37) for more details. 

As a caster’s Path skills rise, his magical power increases exponentially. Not only is he able to soak larger penalties and overcome the resistance of others, but he can accumulate far more [ambient energy](Gathering Ambient Enegy) (pp. 20-21), allowing him to cast much larger spells. 

A caster’s Path skill can never exceed the lower of his [[Thaumatology]] skill or (12 + [[Magery]] level); training is just as important as raw power. [[Magery]] does not add to Path skills. Bonuses from [[Higher Purpose]] (p. 5), [[Ritual Mastery]] (p. 6), [grimoires](Grimores) (pp. 30-32), etc., can raise effective skill above this cap, however.

###### Default Use 

Any serious caster should start with [[Thaumatology]] and then buy up his Path skills. However, it is possible to use Paths at default; in fact, many amateur casters work rituals this way (often with disastrous results). 

Every Path defaults to [[Thaumatology]]-6. Thus, someone who has at least one point in Thaumatology can cast spells! However, a defaulted Path skill cannot exceed 12, regardless of how high the caster’s Thaumatology skill or [[Magery]] level is. This means that an untrained caster with Thaumatology-18 casts spells exactly the same as one with Thaumatology-25, because all ritual rolls are made against the Path skill (in this case, 12), not against Thaumatology. 

Example: Little Timmy has Magery 0 but knows barely enough about magic to be dangerous (Thaumatology-10 and no Path skills). He attempts to work a spell to turn his math teacher into a frog. His default Path of Body is 4. His energy accumulation rolls (p. 20) fail several times, and then eventually critically fail. Later, the math teacher wonders why Timmy stopped showing up for class

###### Effects

There are seven spell effects for each Path: [[Sense]], [[Strengthen]], [[Restore]], [[Control]], [[Destroy]], [[Create]], and [[Transform]]. (See pp. 15-16 for details.) Spell effects are not learned separately; anyone who knows a Path knows how to work all of its associated effects. Each spell effect can be broken into [[Lesser and Greater effects]]. 

The difference between Lesser and Greater varies by Path, but it often depends on how believable, natural, simple, or subtle the effect is; in all cases, the GM makes this decision. For example, a lightning bolt striking someone under a stormy sky is perfectly natural – but a lightning bolt shooting out of a mage’s fingertips, or striking someone under a clear sky, is not! If there is any doubt, treat it as a Greater effect. 

The Paths below include the list of possible effects, with samples of what each can do. These are only examples – there is an infinite number of things which can be accomplished with each effect! Many of the examples cannot be accomplished with just the spell effect, however, and also require spell modifiers (pp. 16-18).

[[Path of Body (Yesod)]]
[[Path of Chance (Hod)]]
[[Path of Crossroads (Tiphareth)]]
[[Path of Energy (Geburah)]]
[[Path of Magic (Chesed)]]
[[Path of Matter (Netzach)]]
[[Path of Mind (Chokmah)]]
[[Path of Spirit (Binah)]]
[[Path of Undead (Malkuth)]]

### Performing Magic

#### Define The ritual

These rules assume that the caster is an adept – someone who possesses the Ritual Adept (p. 6) advantage. If this is not the case, be sure to read Non-Adepts and Magic (pp. 19-20).

Every spell must be defined clearly; e.g., “Using Lesser Strengthen Mind, everyone within four yards of me at the time that I cast the spell will gain Per+2 for the next hour.” That definition includes the spell effect (Lesser Strengthen Mind) and all of the applicable modifiers (Area of Effect, Range, Altered Traits, and Duration). A caster who uses the same ritual regularly should consider writing it down with a name (e.g., “Bestow Awareness”), to save the trouble of recalculating the energy cost each time. He may also want Ritual Mastery (p. 6) for it. See Specific Definition (p. 19) for more on what makes a spell unique, and Chapter 4 for worked examples

The energy requirement for a ritual depends on the spell effect(s) and any applicable modifiers. The GM must adjudicate the details, and should feel free to modify the energy cost (up or down) for circumstances not covered here. The basic formula is:

$Energy Cost = (spell effects + modifiers) * Greater effects multiplier.$

For many spells, there will be multiple ways to accomplish the same thing. Banishing a ghost could be done with Lesser Destroy Crossroads (to disrupt its connection to our plane) or Greater Control Undead (to force it to move on). Telekinetically lifting a gun could be Greater Create Energy + Greater Control Energy (to create and direct kinetic energy) or Greater Control Matter (to empower the gun with the ability to move). The GM should be willing to accept any plausible combination of effects; a smart caster is supposed to play to his strengths!

The caster must define the parameters; he doesn’t gain any “inside knowledge” of the values he should use. If he chooses the wrong spell effects or fails to include a high enough spell modifier, he won’t know it until after his casting is successful . . . and his spell has no effect. (And even then, he may not realize why!)

#### Spell Effects

While the Path skill used determines the subject of the spell, the effect determines what happens to that subject. Every Path includes all of the effects below; the difficulty of working a “harder” effect is represented by a higher energy cost.

Any ritual that accomplishes more than one thing will require multiple spell effects; just add the costs together. For example, a spell to locate a person (specifically, his mind), communicate with him, and help him resist others trying to invade his mind would use Lesser Sense Mind ¥2 (one to locate and one to communicate) + Lesser Strengthen Mind (to aid resistance). One that boosted the subject’s ST, DX, IQ, HT, and Magic Resistance by a small amount would use Lesser Strengthen Body x3 + Lesser Strengthen Mind + Greater Destroy Magic.

There is no limit to the number of spell effects or to the number of Paths that can be combined – though mixed-Path spells are slightly harder to cast (Choose the Skill, pp. 19-20). Note how many Greater effects are being used in the spell; this doesn’t change the costs here, but it will significantly affect the final cost of the spell (Greater Effects Multiplier, pp. 18-19). In addition to the general notes for each effect, see the many examples listed under the Path skills (pp. 6-12).

[[Sense]] 
Cost: 2 
Learn something about the subject or communicate with the subject.

[[Strengthen]] 
Cost: 3 
Protect, enhance, or otherwise augment the subject. This must be used to improve an existing quality within the subject, not to add totally new capabilities. For example, normal eyesight could be expanded to add Infravision, but arms could not be transformed into wings.

[[Restore]] 
Cost: 4 
Heal the subject, or undo a transformation. A Restore spell rarely needs a duration; if it heals the subject back to his normal state, he will remain that way. 

[[Control]] 
Cost: 5 
Direct or move the subject, without changing it fundamentally. For tangible subjects, this includes physical movement, similar to telekinesis. 

[[Destroy]]
Cost: 5 
Damage or weaken the subject. Greater Destroy effects allow for partial destructions – the removal of a concept or aspect that is fundamental to the subject, without affecting it otherwise. Sample partial destructions include removing fire’s ability to burn (but not its ambient heat and light), removing a ghost’s ability to materialize (but leaving it otherwise unharmed and present), and removing a column’s ability to support weight (without affecting its mass). 

[[Create]] 
Cost: 6 
Bring the subject into being from nothing. Create cannot produce anything specific or unique; e.g., a particular person or the Holy Grail. Objects produced by Create effects are drawn from the caster’s mind. When creating manufactured goods (not raw materials), poor visualization can produce useless junk! If the spell is successful, the caster must also roll against any skill used to design, build, or maintain the product, with a bonus equal to the ritual’s margin of success; failure means it isn’t properly formed. Difficult items may impose a penalty on this roll; the GM may assign a modifier or use the (very rough!) guidelines below, based on how expensive the item is.

[[Transform]] 
Cost: 8 
Significantly alter the subject. If none of the other effects seem to cover something, use Transform. Crossing between two categories requires a Transform effect for both Paths; e.g., to turn a tree into a stone pillar, use Greater Transform Body + Greater Transform Matter. You do not need to use Altered Traits (below) to explicitly add Alternate Form; changing things is what this spell effect does. It may seem odd at first glance for Transform to cost more than Create; that means it’s simpler to (e.g.) create a sword from nothing than to transform a stick into a sword. This is because Transform is often used to solve two problems at once – it can get rid of an obstacle and produce something useful, all in one fell swoop! In addition, Transform effects that produce manufactured goods do not require the craft roll described under Create (above) if the original item was sufficiently similar (in the GM’s opinion) to the end result. For example, using Transform to turn a sandwich into a pistol would require a craft roll, but using it to turn a toy pistol into a real one would not.

#### SPELL MODIFIERS

Not all spells require modifiers. For example, a touchbased Lesser Restore Mind effect to snap someone out of being stunned would need no modifiers at all; the spell effect handles it just fine. If there’s any question about whether a given modifier is required to accomplish a certain goal, the GM (as always) has the final word. Spell modifiers never decrease the cost of a spell. A modifier may be free (+0 energy) for certain effects, but it will never have a negative energy cost.

##### [[Afflictions]]

Stunning a foe (mentally or physically) adds no additional energy; the spell effect is enough. For the other states on pp. B428-429, this costs +1 energy for every +5% it’s worth as an enhancement to Affliction (pp. B35-36). For example, a nausea spell would require +6 energy. In general, a separate spell effect is needed for each affliction; the GM may make an exception if he feels that two conditions are very closely related.

##### [[Altered Traits]]

Any spell that adds or worsens disadvantages, reduces or removes advantages, or lowers attributes or characteristics adds +1 energy for every 5 character points removed.

One that adds or improves advantages, reduces or removes disadvantages, or increases attributes or characteristics adds +1 energy for every 1 character point added. Any disadvantage with a self-control roll (p. B120) allows the target a chance to avoid it; multiply the value of the disadvantage by 2.5 if there is no self-control roll allowed.

The GM may permit a single spell effect to alter multiple traits, but only if they make sense together; e.g., a Lesser Destroy Body effect that adds Hard of Hearing -10 and Protected Hearing 5 for a net +7 energy.

If a trait has been artificially reduced (e.g., by another spell), a spell that adds it back to the subject will “heal” the loss permanently. See Restore (p. 16) and the example under Magic vs. Magic (p. 24).

You cannot add Magery, Ritual Adept, etc., and any HP or FP added cannot be sacrificed for magical energy. See Stacking Spells (p. 15) for why

##### [[Area of Effect]]

Rituals that will affect more than one subject need this modifier. Figure the spherical area of effect, find its radius in yards on the [[Size and Speed/Range Table]] (p. B550), and add twice the “*Size*” value for that line to the energy cost (minimum +2). If the caster is not in the area, calculate range (p. 18) from him to the nearest edge

Excluding potential targets is harder – add another +1 energy for every two specific subjects in the area that won’t be affected by the spell. The caster must designate each of these subjects explicitly, as if mentally “flagging” each one as excluded. “Exclude Sam, Kathryn, Brad, and those two guys over there” is fine, but “exclude every Martian” or “exclude everyone on my team” is not. For spells that do external damage (below) or otherwise fill the area with some sort of physical effect, excluding a target also allows the caster to exclude as much unoccupied space around it as he wishes. This makes noncircular areas of effect possible.

![[Pasted image 20250130191151.png]]

##### [[Bestows a (Bonus or Penalty)]]

Use this table to determine the energy cost of bonuses or penalties, based on whether the ritual will add a modifier to a broad range of rolls (e.g., active defense rolls, Sense rolls, or a wildcard skill), a moderate range (e.g., rolls to hide or Vision rolls), or a narrow range (e.g., Climbing rolls or social rolls affecting a specific person). You can give a penalty to magic use, but not a bonus; see [[Stacking Spells]] (p. 15) for more.

![[Pasted image 20250130191405.png]]

##### Damage 

If the spell will cause damage, whether directly or indirectly, consult the Spell Modifiers Table (p. 18) and then apply the rules here. If a spell lists “damage” without specifying whether it’s internal or external, assume internal. This modifier cannot be combined with Duration (p. 18), but see Enhancements (below).

Internal (Direct) Damage 
Most spells work like maledictions – if the subject fails to resist, he takes the listed damage. His DR does not protect! The spell effect is invisible to mundane senses; a bystander wouldn’t realize the subject has been injured unless he screams, falls over, etc

External (Indirect) Damage
 Some spells don’t target the subject directly, but instead apply external force; e.g., the classic “fireball.” For simplicity, this external magical force is referred to as a missile. A missile spell isn’t cast on the target, so there’s no resistance roll, no range (p. 18), and the subject’s weight (p. 18) doesn’t matter. Instead, the spell creates a missile in the caster’s hand. 
 Once created, the missile has to be delivered by touch (using DX, Brawling, etc.) or thrown using Innate Attack. This requires an attack roll on a later turn. It is not part of the spell – it is entirely mundane and uses the normal combat rules. If thrown, the missile has Acc 3, Range 10/100, RoF 1, and Rcl 1. You may hold on to the missile for as long as you like, but it occupies your hand and goes off immediately if you set it down or drop it (roll Will to avoid this if injured)! 
 A missile does triple the damage shown on the Spell Modifiers Table (e.g., a 3d+3 fireball for +1 energy) – or double damage if it’s also explosive. It is blatant and visible, and can be blocked or dodged normally. The target’s DR protects against it. It’s possible to cast an indirect-damage ritual that doesn’t involve a hand-held missile (e.g., a lightning bolt hitting the target from the sky). Use the same rules, but with the following changes: 
 
 - The attack happens as soon as the spell is complete. The caster does not have to use another turn to attack. 
- The caster still rolls against Innate Attack to hit, but cannot aim, use an All-Out Attack, etc. 
 - The spell must include energy for the range (p. 18) from caster to target, since the missile is being created at a distance.

##### Enhancements

Damage caused by rituals rarely requires enhancements, but they can be added if necessary. First, tally up the total energy required for the damage modifier (only). For example, a spell that inflicts 3d+1 cutting (internally) requires +14 energy for damage: the +9 from the table, multiplied by 1.5 for cutting. Then use the appropriate rule:

20 or Less Energy: Add another 1 energy for every +5% or fraction thereof. 
21 or More Energy: Apply the enhancement percentage to the damage modifier energy cost (not the cost of the whole spell); round up.

You may add limitations, but only to bring down the cost of the enhancements. The net value cannot go below +0% and there is always a minimum +1 energy for adding any enhancements. (Adding just limitations is allowed as well, but it doesn’t reduce the cost of the spell at all!)

Never add enhancements that replicate existing spell modifiers. For example, you cannot add Area Effect or Selective Area (use Area of Effect, above), Increased Range or Long-Range (use Range, p. 18), and so on. Duration is an exception; any sort of enduring damage should be represented with enhancements such as Cyclic or Persistent.
