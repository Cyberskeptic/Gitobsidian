Cost: 8 
Significantly alter the subject. If none of the other effects seem to cover something, use Transform. Crossing between two categories requires a Transform effect for both Paths; e.g., to turn a tree into a stone pillar, use Greater Transform Body + Greater Transform Matter. You do not need to use Altered Traits (below) to explicitly add Alternate Form; changing things is what this spell effect does. It may seem odd at first glance for Transform to cost more than Create; that means it’s simpler to (e.g.) create a sword from nothing than to transform a stick into a sword. This is because Transform is often used to solve two problems at once – it can get rid of an obstacle and produce something useful, all in one fell swoop! In addition, Transform effects that produce manufactured goods do not require the craft roll described under Create (above) if the original item was sufficiently similar (in the GM’s opinion) to the end result. For example, using Transform to turn a sandwich into a pistol would require a craft roll, but using it to turn a toy pistol into a real one would not.
