The word “decan” originally comes from the Greek word dekanos, meaning “ruler of ten.” Each decan governs a 10° segment of the zodiacal arc; thus, all 36 of them collectively hold power over the entire (360°) astrological compass. Casters who realize this can tap into the energy of these decans when invoking a ritual. If these rules are used, they replace the simpler ones under Traditional Trappings (p. 19). 

The sephirah of each Path has four associated decans, as detailed in Thaumatology (pp. 248-252). By invoking the correspondences (places and materials) associated with a decan, a caster can draw upon its energy for his spell. This process becomes even more efficient when invoking correspondences from two, three, or even all four decans! The decans being appeased must correspond to the Path skill being used for the spell; see Choose the Skill (pp. 19-20). 

Each of the correspondences below gives a certain number of decan points (DP). At the end, these will be used to determine the final energy discount for the spell. Every spell starts with 0 DP. 

Place: If the spell is being cast in a place favorable to the decan, add 5 DP. If the place is an unequivocal archetype of the decan’s nature, the GM may increase this, to a maximum of 10 DP. You may get only one place bonus per decan – and it’s hard to get this from more than one decan at a time! 

Materials: Using materials appropriate to the decan adds DP, as per the Decanic Materials Table (below). Expensive materials (worth more than half a month’s income) are more effective than inexpensive ones, and materials that will be consumed by the ritual pack more punch than reusable ones. (Of course, the reusable ones are much more convenient!) You may acquire multiple material bonuses for the same decan, but they give diminishing returns; use the “First” column for the largest-DP one, the “Second” column for the next-largest, and so on. 

Add up the DP accumulated for all four decans and determine the energy discount based on total DP: 0 to 20 DP: 
The DP are the percentage discount. For example, 10 DP becomes -10%. 
21 to 60 DP:  Subtract 20 from the DP, halve the result (round up), and then add 20. That is the percentage discount. For example, 30 DP becomes -25%. 
61 or more DP: Subtract 60 from the DP, quarter the result (round up), and then add 40. That is the percentage discount. For example, 80 DP becomes -45%. 

The GM is entitled to adjust the final discount by up to ±5% based on how cool, appropriate, and evocative the ritual was (as described by the player). 

Example: Cole needs to cast a powerful Path of Mind spell to search the memories of an entire neighborhood – that’s a lot of energy. He decides to call upon the associated decans: Harpax, Methiax, Naôth, and Ruax. First, he chooses his casting place carefully, keeping it close to the neighborhood to minimize his range modifier. He finds an artists’ studio on the campus of a university. Using the information in Thaumatology, the GM agrees to let it count as a place for Methiax and Naôth: 10 DP! That night, Cole breaks in with a bulky load of offerings. For Harpax, he wears his expensive green jade necklace (5 DP) and burns amanita mushrooms (2 DP). For Methiax, he couldn’t find anything, but he sets off the reusable flashbulbs in the studio (2 DP) and puts a fractal screensaver on the computer (1 DP). For Naôth, he carefully unpacks a rare Les Paul guitar a friend lent him (5 DP, but the GM makes it 6 DP when he succeeds at a default Musical Instrument roll to play it) and burns bay leaves (2 DP). Finally, for Ruax, he breaks out his prize: an expensive, highly illegal bouquet of opium poppies (10 DP) that he stole. He scatters them into a spiral pattern (1 DP) before burning them. Cole’s total is 39 DP. To find his discount, he subtracts 20 (19), halves the result (10), then adds 20 (30). His spell’s energy cost is reduced by 30% – a tremendous savings! 

Smart casters will carry expensive, reusable items that correspond to their favorite Paths. For example, Cole carries that jade necklace around with him, because he knows how handy it is for his Path of Mind spells.
