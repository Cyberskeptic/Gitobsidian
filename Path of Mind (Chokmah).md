Prerequisite: [[Thaumatology]].

The realm of Mind is the thought processes of sentient, living beings – typically humans or animals, but this may include other, harder-to-classify creatures (like lycanthropes) in some settings. Lesser Mind effects must be either noninvasive (e.g., voluntary communication) or limited to a single, specific aspect of the mind (such as a single memory or Hearing rolls). Greater Mind effects can ignore these restrictions and affect the mind fully. Exception: This dichotomy, and the examples below, assume sapient (IQ 6+) beings. When dealing with nonsapient (IQ 1-5) beings, Lesser Mind effects are enough for any effect; e.g., Lesser Control Mind is enough to achieve total domination over a typical wolf. This Path is often used to add mental advantages or disadvantages to a subject. While the Basic Set labels certain traits with a “mental” icon, the GM is allowed to interpret this in a more restrictive manner. For example, Luck is in the domain of Path of Chance, and thus should not be added with a Path of Mind ritual, even though it does technically have the “mental” icon. Altered Time Rate is as much physical as it is mental, and thus doesn’t necessarily fit unless limited to mental actions only, and so on.

[[Sense]] Mind: Lesser Sense Mind can locate the nearest person, track down a specific person known to the caster, enter into telepathic communication with someone, or sense whether the subject is hostile. Greater Sense Mind can read someone’s mind against his will, search through someone’s memories, or locate someone based on someone else’s description of him (through tapping into his impression of the person). 

[[Strengthen]] Mind: Lesser [[Strengthen]] Mind can improve someone’s IQ, Will, or Per by up to about 30% (rounded up), add any exotic or supernatural mental advantages that the GM would permit the subject to have with an Unusual Background (e.g., Extra Tracking 1, in most games), add any mundane mental advantages, provide up to a +5 a bonus for mental actions (or resisting mental disadvantages), or provide any degree of bonus to resist mental effects (e.g., Influence rolls). Greater [[Strengthen]] Mind can surpass the limits of Lesser Strengthen Mind (e.g., improving Per by 100%) or add any mental advantage unless the GM has explicitly disallowed it for PCs and all NPCs (of any race or species). 

[[Restore]] Mind: Lesser Restore Mind can recover a lost or suppressed memory, heal IQ damaged by a spell, snap the subject out of being mentally stunned, overcome temporarily mental penalties (e.g., from Affliction or a spell), or let a nonsapient animal recover from any mental condition. Greater Restore Mind can temporarily remove permanent mental disadvantages, counter an effect that’s completely taken over the subject’s mind (e.g., Mind Control or Possession), or provide the equivalent of a year’s worth of psychoanalysis with a single spell.

[[Control]] Mind: Lesser Control Mind can force the target to take one brief, simple, mental action (e.g., speaking a few words or losing his train of thought), change his emotional state (perhaps causing a [[Fright Check]]), or make it impossible for him to voluntarily take one specific action. Greater Control Mind is classic “mind control” – it can be used to give the subject direct orders, cause an incapacitating mental affliction, or inflict any “self-imposed” (p. B121) mental disadvantage or one with a self-control roll. Destroy Mind: Lesser Destroy Mind can remove a memory; impose any mental irritating affliction (p. B428); mentally stun someone; reduce IQ, Will, or Per by up to 30%; or give the subject up to -5 to specific IQ-, Will-, or Per-based rolls. Greater Destroy Mind can trigger incapacitating afflictions, larger penalties, or any mental disadvantage not covered by Control Mind (above). 

[[Create]] Mind: Lesser Create Mind can imbue a nonsentient creation with an animal mind (IQ 1-5); this is typically bundled with rituals to animate statues, conjured beasts, and so on. This spell effect includes “free” IQ appropriate for the creation; e.g., IQ 3 for a summoned horse (Animal Training, p. B458). For more intelligence, use Altered Traits (pp. 16-17) to add IQ. It can also implant a memory. Greater Create Mind covers making sentient minds, granting up to IQ 8 “for free” in most circumstances. 

[[Transform]] Mind: Lesser Transform Mind can force a simple but fundamental shift in how a mind sees itself (e.g., making a human believe that he’s a hawk) or make a minor adjustment to a memory, moral code, or similar disadvantage. Greater Transform Mind can affect the fundamental nature of a mind; e.g., causing a human mind to act as a digital intelligence. It can also be cast on two subjects to switch minds.
