Stunning a foe (mentally or physically) adds no additional energy; the spell effect is enough. For the other states on pp. B428-429, this costs +1 energy for every +5% itâ€™s worth as an enhancement to Affliction (pp. B35-36). For example, a nausea spell would require +6 energy. In general, a separate spell effect is needed for each affliction; the GM may make an exception if he feels that two conditions are very closely related.
