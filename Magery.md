Magery (Ritual Path) see p. B66 
`Note: This is a variant of standard Magery. For simplicity, this work will always refer to it as just “Magery,” as most settings will feature only one or the other. If this is not true in yours, see Mixing Magic Systems (p. 45). Regardless, standard Magery and Magery (Ritual Path) do not interact in any way.` 

While anyone can work Ritual Path magic, you are particularly good at it. This advantage comes in levels; there is no limit to the number of levels you may have, unless the GM sets one. You must purchase Magery 0 before buying higher levels of Magery. Magery 0 allows you to cast spells at full skill; without it, you are at -5 to work rituals. See Non-Adepts and Magic (pp. 19-20) for more. Magery 0 grants no other benefits – it cannot detect magic, etc.

Higher levels of Magery (Ritual Path) do not add to any skills, magical or otherwise. (This is a significant change from standard Magery!) Instead, Magery 1+ gives three benefits: 

*Higher Maximum Skills*: A non-mage’s Path skills (pp. 6-12) cannot exceed 12. Each level of Magery improves this cap by 1; e.g., with Magery 4, you can learn Path skills up to 16. 

*Mana Reserve*: Every mage has a mana reserve (p. 21) equal to 3xMagery. This allows him to cast minor spells without having to harm himself or slowly accumulate energy. 

*Additional Conditional Spells*: A caster may have (Thaumatology skill + Magery level) conditional spells (pp. 25-26) active at once. Thus, improving Magery raises this cap. Magery can be learned after character creation. It reflects training and skill as much as it does any inborn mystical potential. (Impressive inherent magical power is better represented by Ritual Adept, p. 6.)
