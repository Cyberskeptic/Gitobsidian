Prerequisite: [[Thaumatology]]. 

Energy includes fire, electricity, kinetic energy, light, sound, and more. It is a versatile Path, offering many potential effects, but its domain ends where others begin; e.g., disrupting electrical impulses to a subject’s legs requires [[Path of Body (Yesod)|Path Of Body]], not Path of Energy. Lesser Energy effects can affect normal forms of the energy in simple, natural, likely ways; it allows the caster to do things with the energy that it would already be “inclined” to do. Greater Energy effects can affect weird forms of the energy or cause it to do complex, unnatural things. 

[[Sense]] Energy: Lesser Sense Energy can detect electrical current, analyze the spectrum of a fire (e.g., to identify its fuel), locate the nearest source of light, or clarify a garbled sound. Greater Sense Energy can use energy as a sense (e.g., “seeing” via reflections of your own voice, like sonar), separate an audio recording into every one of its component sounds, or track a particular electron as it passes through an appliance.

[[Strengthen]] Energy: Either version of Strengthen Energy can increase a fire’s damage or rate of growth, brighten a light source, impart additional speed to a moving object, or cause a shout to carry further. Lesser effects can impart enough energy to double the effect (e.g., doubling the Vision penalty inflicted by a light source, or making a fire inflict twice the damage); Greater ones can go beyond that.

[[Restore]] Energy: Lesser Restore Energy can keep an electrical current moving through resistance, rekindle a dying fire, or counter the effects of deceleration on a vehicle. Greater Restore Energy is similar, but can even affect “killed” energy; e.g., keeping electricity flowing after being switched off or relighting a fire that died for lack of fuel.

[[Control]] Energy: Lesser Control Energy can reverse electrical polarity, “shove” an object in motion so it heads in (roughly) a new direction, dictate the direction and rate at which a fire spreads, or alter the tone of someone’s speech (though not with enough control to imitate another person). Greater Control Energy can exert perfect control over a moving object, make a person’s voice sound like someone else’s, or make a fire stretch out and attack someone.

[[Destroy]] Energy: Lesser Destroy Energy can reduce the strength of energy; it can also stop energy completely if there is a natural means by which that could happen. For example, it can weaken a fire or put it out completely (because fires die naturally), but it could only lessen the strength of sunlight on a bright day (because there’s no realistic way to make the sun stop shining). Greater Destroy Energy can kill the flow of any sort of energy, no matter how unrealistic, or do partial destructions, such as destroying a fire’s ability to burn people while still leaving its ambient heat and light.

[[Create]] Energy: Lesser Create Energy can bring energy into being in a believable and natural manner. It can create fire if there’s fuel, create electricity within a circuit, or create noise from something that could potentially make that sound. Greater Create Energy can ignore this restriction, creating a fireball in the caster’s hand, flooding a cave with light, or launching an object into the air (with kinetic energy). Many Create Energy spells also include a Control Energy effect; if not, once created, the energy acts as the laws of physics dictate!

[[Transform]] Energy: Lesser Transform Energy can change alternating current into direct current, shift visible light into infrared light, or completely alter the words someone is saying. Greater Transform Energy can turn one type of energy into another – fire can become sound, kinetic energy can become light, and so on.
