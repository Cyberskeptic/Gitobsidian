Prerequisite: [[Thaumatology]]. 

Covers luck, odds, and entropy. This is often used for “metaeffects,” such as influencing die rolls; [[Bestows a (Bonus or Penalty)]] (p. 17) is a common modifier! When used to alter events which would not normally involve a die roll, the GM may always estimate the odds of it happening, convert this to a target number using Probability of Success (p. B171), and apply any bonus or penalty to that roll. The degree of the bonus or penalty does not affect whether the ritual is Lesser or Greater; a +5 boon to a skill roll is no more obvious than +1. Blatant effects rarely suit the Path of Chance; if the GM allows them, they are always [[Greater effects]]. For predicting events (e.g., winning the lottery or accurately betting on horses), use a [[Divination]] (p. 24).

 In addition, Lesser Chance effects must target discrete subjects (such as a person). Greater Chance effects can be more nebulous and metaphorical. For example, with an area modifier (p. 17), Lesser Chance could affect the fates of everyone who lived within a certain hamlet, but Greater Chance could alter the fate of the village itself (e.g., giving -5 to all economic or commercial rolls involving the town, regardless of who makes them). If the conceptual subject is embodied by a spirit or collective consciousness, it resists the spell (if desired) and controls any granted traits. If not, it is unresisted, and the caster sets the conditions under which any granted traits will be used; e.g., “The Serendipity activates during any fire or similar disaster, to minimize property damage.” 
 
 [[Sense]] Chance: Lesser Sense Chance can provide the accurate odds of any one event happening as of this moment (but cannot actually see the future), allow a lucky guess (treat as Intuition, p. B63), or tell if something is interfering with probability nearby. Greater Sense Chance is most often used for divinations (p. 24). 
 
 [[Strengthen]] Chance: Either version of Strengthen Chance can make a likely event (target number of 11 or higher on 3d) more likely, or an unlikely event (9 or lower) less likely. Regardless of whether a bonus or penalty was chosen, the modifier will “flip” as necessary to make this happen. This makes it a poor choice for combat charms (pp. 26-28), as the odds can change drastically from second to second! It can also add Daredevil as a trait. 
 
 [[Restore]] Chance: Restore Chance is most commonly used to counter the effects of Destroy Chance (below), but it can also be used in rituals that grant some form of Luck, Serendipity, or Unluckiness – all of which allow randomness to creep back into that which was thought to have been set in stone. Control Chance: This is a popular effect, as it allows precise manipulation of fate. It can be used as for Strengthen Chance (above), but to adjust the die roll in either direction, regardless of the odds; e.g., a flat +3 to hit in combat, regardless of effective skill. Or it can add Super Luck (which requires this level of precision). 
 
 [[Destroy]] Chance: Can be used as Strengthen Chance, but reversed – that is, making likely events less possible or unlikely events more possible. Alternatively, it can be used to remove or counter the effects of Luck-based traits, such as those discussed for other Chance effects. If karma or fate exists in the setting in some form, Greater Destroy Chance can also sever a person’s ties to it. 
 
 [[Create]] Chance: Can add a Destiny (good or bad) to the subject, but is more often reserved for causing weird things to happen. Unless the GM is dead set against an event being possible, he should give it fair “impossible odds,” such as “roll 0 or less on 3d.” A Create Chance ritual that adds enough of a bonus can make this (theoretically) happen, though it has to get the odds to “3 or less” to allow a roll at all. 
 
 [[Transform]] Chance: Allows rituals that warp luck and fate. This can change any of the previously discussed luck-related traits, rewrite a Destiny, or add Cursed or Weirdness Magnet. It can also do interesting things like tying two subjects’ fates together or swapping the odds of each finding true love.
