In any setting featuring Ritual Path magic, [[Magery]] does not add to Thaumatology skill. Instead, Magery and Thaumatology act as a dual cap on Path skills (pp. 6-12). Otherwise, this skill works exactly as described in the Basic Set. Thaumatology is a logical core skill if magic is supposed to work as fantasy wizards or [Hermetic](Hermeticism) mages believe: The caster exerts his will over that of the universe, with somewhat predictable results. See Alternative Core Skills (p. 13) for different options.

# Thaumatology 
	IQ/Very Hard 
Default: IQ-7*. * 
`*There is no default in a nonmagical setting, or for those who have never witnessed “real” magic. This is the academic study of magical theory and the “physics” of mana.*` 

Anyone may learn this skill, but it is easier for a mage; add Magery to IQ when learning this skill, just as for spells. 

The main use for this skill is magical research. When creating a new spell, use the rules for inventing (see Chapter 17), but replace Engineer skill with Thaumatology. A successful skill roll can also identify an unknown spell when you see it cast, deduce the ramifications of a critical success or failure with magic, determine the spells needed to enchant a magic item to perform as desired, etc. The better your roll, the more insight the GM will provide. This is the study of fantasy magic – [[fireball]] spells, rings of power, etc. The equivalent skill for traditional, spirit mediated sorcery is Ritual Magic (p. 218), while holy magic might require Religious Ritual (p. 217) or Theology (p. 226). However, a Thaumatology roll at -5 will allow a thaumatologist to relate these different varieties of magic to “standard” wizardry. Exceptionally weird powers or otherworldly artifacts might give a larger penalty
