Prerequisite: [[Thaumatology]]. 

“Spirit” refers to any being whose spirit and body are one, and who was never “alive” in the sense that we know it. The specifics will depend on the setting, but common examples include fae, elementals, astral denizens, nature spirits, minor gods, demons, angels, and loa. It can also apply to the soul within a living being, though the GM must adjudicate this; most such effects are better represented with Path of Mind (pp. 11- 12). By defaults, ghosts are considered part of the Path of Undead (below), not this Path, as they were formerly alive. If it suits the setting better to treat ghosts as spirit beings, the GM may do so, but he must inform the players before they build their characters. Path of Spirit effects are identical to those of Path of Body (pp. 7-8) or Path of Mind (pp. 11-12), but limited to affect only spirit subjects. Use Lesser Create Spirit to summon up weak and very limited servants, Greater Create Spirit otherwise.
