Prerequisite: [[Thaumatology]]. 

This Path governs spells, magical energy, and the act of casting. It is most commonly relied on for “meta-magical” spells (see [[Meta-Magic]], p. 18, and Magic vs. Magic, p. 24). It is also the Path used to refill a mage’s mana reserve (p. 21). No Path of Magic ritual can be used to improve someone’s ability to cast spells; see [[Stacking Spells]] (p. 15) for details. Lesser Magic effects can target the caster or ambient magic – including active spells, conditional spells (pp. 25-26), and charms (pp. 26-28). Greater Magic effects can involve another person’s casting ability or magic resistance, or magic permanently tied to a place or object. See [[Places of Power]] (pp. 32-33) and [[Enchanted Items]] (pp. 33-35) for examples of the latter. 

[[Sense]] Magic: Lesser Sense Magic can detect spell use, analyze a ritual, locate the nearest charm, or tell the caster if he’s been unknowingly affected by a spell. Greater Sense Magic can identify a mage, seek the nearest adept, determine why a location is a place of power, or determine what an enchanted item does. 

[[Strengthen]] Magic: Lesser Strengthen Magic can oppose an attempt to cancel a spell, or enhance a spell’s ability to punch through a ward (pp. 24-25) or similar “anti-magic shield.” Greater Strengthen Magic can temporarily expand the area covered by a place of power (though not its bonus) or increase the DR or HP of an enchanted item (though not the strength of its enchantment). 

[[Restore]] Magic: Lesser Restore Magic can heal any of the caster’s magical advantages lost to a spell (or curse, etc.), fix an ongoing spell that has been “damaged” in some way by an outside source, or instantly sanctify an area or restore a desecrated one (p. 21). Greater Restore Magic can repair damage done to a place of power, remove a curse preventing someone else from casting spells, or heal metaphysical “damage” done to an enchanted item. 

[[Control]] Magic: Lesser Control Magic can redirect or repurpose a ritual, ward off incoming spells, trigger a conditional spell or charm ahead of time, or shift the subject of a spell. Greater Control Magic can prevent a caster from working a particular type of ritual, prevent him from targeting a particular subject, or take control of an enchanted item. 

[[Destroy]] Magic: Lesser Destroy Magic can counter an existing spell – whether just-cast (see “Blocking” Spells, p. 24), an ongoing effect, or waiting as a conditional spell or charm – or give the caster levels of Magic Resistance (Improved). Greater Destroy Magic can wipe out a caster’s mana reserve, remove his Magery or Ritual Adept advantages, give someone else Magic Resistance, or temporarily suppress the abilities of a place of power or enchanted item. 

[[Create]] Magic: Lesser Create Magic can fill an area with “magical chaff” to penalize spells that pass through it. It is also used to create elixirs (pp. 28-30). Greater Create Magic can make an item or person register as “magical” to spells or senses. Technically, Lesser Create Magic is also used to refill a mana reserve, and Greater Create Magic is also used for Slow and Sure enchanting (pp. 34-35), but neither of those actions relies on the standard spellcasting rules. 

[[Transform]] Magic: Lesser Transform Magic can alter an existing spell – though if it needs additional energy, a Lesser Strengthen Magic effect (plus the energy itself) is required as well. Greater Transform Magic can grant an “aspect” to a place of power, making its bonus only usable for one type of ritual, or temporarily shift the owner of an exclusive enchanted item so someone else can use it.
