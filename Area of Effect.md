Rituals that will affect more than one subject need this modifier. Figure the spherical area of effect, find its radius in yards on the [[Size and Speed/Range Table]] (p. B550), and add twice the “*Size*” value for that line to the energy cost (minimum +2). If the caster is not in the area, calculate range (p. 18) from him to the nearest edge

Excluding potential targets is harder – add another +1 energy for every two specific subjects in the area that won’t be affected by the spell. The caster must designate each of these subjects explicitly, as if mentally “flagging” each one as excluded. “Exclude Sam, Kathryn, Brad, and those two guys over there” is fine, but “exclude every Martian” or “exclude everyone on my team” is not. For spells that do external damage (below) or otherwise fill the area with some sort of physical effect, excluding a target also allows the caster to exclude as much unoccupied space around it as he wishes. This makes noncircular areas of effect possible.
