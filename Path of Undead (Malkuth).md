Prerequisite: [[Thaumatology]]. 

This Path governs any being who lived, then died, but is still hanging around for some reason. It includes spectral undead (e.g., ghosts) as well as physical examples (e.g., zombies, vampires, and liches). Path of Undead effects are identical to those of Path of Body (pp. 7-8) or [[Path of Mind (Chokmah)]] (pp. 11-12), but limited to affect only undead subjects. Use Lesser [[Create]] Undead to raise weak, mindless skeletons and zombies, Greater [[Create]] Undead to make anything more potent. See Path of Spirit (above) for an important note on ghosts. With a system as inherently flexible as GURPS, it should be no surprise that there are many ways to customize Ritual Path magic.
